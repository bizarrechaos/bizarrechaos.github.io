In preparation to step my reversing game up I have decided to setup some infrastructure and tools to make it easier to jump straight into malware.

I have a dedicated lab system and in Virtualbox I have pfSense VM that automatically connects to a VPN provider and supplies a network for the following VMs:
Windows, [Remnux](https://remnux.org/), and [Security Onion](https://securityonion.net/)

Both REMnux and Security Onion just released major updates, definitely check them out.

Having the sysytems ready, snapshots taken, I just need a way to obtain malware.
Previously I would use [malshare](https://malshare.com/)

Don't get me wrong, malshare is great, however the submissions arent necessarily "Malicious".
Recently the folks over at Abuse.ch came out with [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/)
What sets MalwareBazaar apart from Malshare is that MalwareBazaar does not accept Adware or PUP/PUA uploads, a typically only acepts new samples.

Being me I can't just be satisfied with a great website, luckily MalwareBazaar has a great API I can take advantage of.
Ive created a qucik little cli tool in python to help me grab some of that sweet sweet malware.

[malwarebazaar-cli](https://github.com/bizarrechaos/malwarebazaar-cli)

Now that you've obtained your malware what do you do with it. Do you have a special harddrive to store it on? Do you only keep it until you have analysed it?
Personally I'm a bit of a horder, so I like to store my in [snake](https://github.com/countercept/snake)

Snake allows me to store malware as well as my analysis notes and it will even perform basic static analysis on the files with plugins called scales.

I will try to post some analysis blogs in the future showcasing the usage of these tools.
